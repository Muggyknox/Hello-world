Hello World!
I'm totally new to coding and computer science in general!
I'm current a university student studying Biology (not really liking it but I'm almost done so might as well finish it)
But I'm slowly starting to become curious of computer science and I want to learn some coding! Maybe even considering a career in the computer science world!
